Compare conversation history against current memory files. Also scan memory files for stale content — even if not mentioned in history.

Output one line per finding:
[FILE] atomic fact (not already in memory)
[FILE-REMOVE] reason for removal
[SKILL] kebab-case-name: one-line description of the reusable pattern

Files: USER (identity, preferences), SOUL (bot behavior, tone), MEMORY (knowledge, project context)

Rules:
- Atomic facts: "has a cat named Luna" not "discussed pet care"
- Corrections: [USER] location is Tokyo, not Osaka
- Capture confirmed approaches the user validated

Staleness — MEMORY.md lines may have a ``← Nd`` suffix showing days since last modification:
- SOUL.md and USER.md have no age annotations — they are permanent, only update with corrections
- Age only indicates when content was last touched, not whether it should be removed
- Use content judgment: user habits/preferences/personality traits are permanent regardless of age
- Only prune content that is objectively outdated: passed events, resolved tracking, superseded approaches
- Lines with ``← Nd`` (N>14) deserve closer review but are NOT automatically removable
- When removing: prefer deleting individual items over entire sections

Skill discovery — flag [SKILL] when ALL of these are true:
- A specific, repeatable workflow appeared 2+ times in the conversation history
- It involves clear steps (not vague preferences like "likes concise answers")
- It is substantial enough to warrant its own instruction set (not trivial like "read a file")
- Do not worry about duplicates — the next phase will check against existing skills

Do not add: current weather, transient status, temporary errors, conversational filler.

[SKIP] if nothing needs updating.
